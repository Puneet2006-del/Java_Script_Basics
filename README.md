# My JavaScript Learning Journey

This repository captures my hands-on progression through **core JavaScript fundamentals**, **modern features**, and **real-world use cases**. Whether you're starting from scratch or brushing up on JS quirks, this is your roadmap to mastering one of the webâ€™s most powerful languages.

# Topics Covered

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the concepts I've explored:

|  Category                | Concepts Explored                                                                  |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Basics**               | `var`, `let`, `const`, data types, operators, conditionals                         |
| **Loops**                | `for`, `while`, `do...while`, `forEach`, `for...of`, `for...in`                    |
| **Functions**            | Declaration, expressions, arrow functions, default parameters                      |
| **Arrays & Objects**     | CRUD operations, array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`), object manipulation    |
| **DOM Manipulation**     | Element selection, event handling, dynamic styling and behavior                    |
| **Asynchronous JS**      | `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, Promises, `async/await`, `fetch` API usage            |
| **Modern Features**      | Destructuring, spread/rest operators, template literals, optional chaining         |
| **The `this` Keyword**   | Contextual behavior in functions, objects, and arrow functions                     |
| **Error Handling**       | `try...catch`, custom error messages                                               |
| **Advanced Concepts**    | Callback functions, closures, scope, hoisting                                      |
